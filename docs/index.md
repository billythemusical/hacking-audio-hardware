## Course Description
Using the seminal book [*Handmade Electronic Music*](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/141j2p5/nyu_aleph003835343) by Nicholas Collins as our guide, students will experiment building, modifying, hacking basic analog electronics and audio circuits in a hands-on environment.  From opening up common battery-powered objects like toys and radios, we can gain strategic access to their circuit boards and change their intended behavior - for predictable and unpredictable outcomes.  But it is almost always a satisfying endeavor.

Beginning with an introduction to these various DIY (Do-It-Yourself) practices, students advance quickly to building their own circuits with a minimum amount of electronic components. Many of the projects in this course center on common integrated circuits (aka: IC's or microchips), which we will bend, break, and remake in order to create tools/instruments for sonic and aesthetic ends.  Other topics covered include circuit sniffing, circuit bending, alternative speaker construction, and creative uses for transducers, magnetic tape heads, contact mics, radio receivers and transmitters, and magnetic pickups of various types.

Students that successfully complete this course will:
1. Have a very basic understanding of how electrical circuits work, and develop a working knowledge
of basic electronic components including but not limited to IC’s, resistors, capacitors, and diodes.
2. Be able to construct their own circuits both in prototype and finished, useable forms for
presentation and/or performance.
3. Acquire skills soldering together and working with basic audio equipment including microphones, amplifiers, and cables.
4. Have a basic knowledge of the history and development of hardware hacking and circuit bending,
and their contexts in the fields of experimental music and fine art.
5. Understand the ethos and culture of hardware hacking and its important place in DIY (do-it-yourself) art communities.
6. Learn to provide and receive constructive criticism on work produced in the class.

## Course Overview & Slides

**Week 1 - Introductions, [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmMsHMCfXIE_s8nDgVjvcms0XinGn-VsMpUDeaeRRd0/edit?usp=sharing), Lecture: A Speaker is a mic is a speaker, Ground Rules** [(Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qheYEmGxHhcfj3TvRRTWEnvLvEMnhZB82_XswJIgf9U/edit?usp=sharing)
- ASSIGNMENT - DUE NEXT CLASS: Add your blog to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N3ReFHLPdkrUOZKwgPqg1gQX5DbbF7SZ2JsOboCK1Vc/edit#gid=0) 
- TO DO: 
  - Sign up for training to use the [IDM Proto Lab](http://idm.engineering.nyu.edu/protolab/) (preferred) or the [Tandon Makerspace](https://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/training-and-reservations/)  
  - Get your own [rechargeable 9v battery setup](https://www.amazon.com/EBL-Rechargeable-Batteries-Battery-Charger/dp/B079G37Y61/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=9v+rechargeable+batteries+with+charger&qid=1631477602&s=electronics&sr=1-3)  

**Week 2 - Rules of Electronics, Basic Electronic Components, Audio Connectors** [(Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1efWNUDPk0h1TynfMdZVpLxOjdQhohWu7YLQNH0dOrB4/edit?usp=sharing)  

**Week 3 - Breadboarding, Your First Oscillator, Adding Modifications** [(Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-EDzDrOS77cCitP-0Bf-hZKDujBbLkg2Xf4AGk78QNk/edit#slide=id.gf256d10b19_0_25)  

- ASSIGNMENT - DUE NEXT CLASS: 
  - Try one of the following:  

    a. Assemble a variation of the basic oscillator circuit we built in class by replacing the potentiometer with another resistive element. There are some examples in the slides for this week and more in our text book, Handmade Electronic Music, 3rd Edition, on page 103.  

    b. Connect any (or all) of the additional oscillators on the 74HC14 chip, although be aware this may not work as expected since we are working with the wrong voltage for the 74HC14 chip.  *Update: we now have the 40106 Hex Inverter chips available.*

  - Post a video of the resulting experiment to your blog with notes on the process.  Even if you fail, show your work and explain what you think has gone wrong.  Mistakes can be very instructive.  

**Week 4 - Breadboarding cont., Reading & Drawing Schematics** [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1seI8x_yt6gibYntiaUch7kJuSkzcuYkVgojwtgdJvfY/edit?usp=sharing)  

**Week 5 - Simple Mixers with Photoresistors & Pots, Enclosures, Amps/Transducers, Alternative Speakers**  [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UQaH8Z6PDEX3RyZpvyM7HtjcS4XLoo4gqNlqg3Z_l8U/edit?usp=sharing)  

  - ASSIGNMENT - DUE OCT 19TH: 
    - Using material from our book or other online resources,  build a circuit that you haven’t made before.  Document your work and post pics and video to your blog.  Talk about what worked and what didn’t.  Did you have to substitute parts?  Did you have to purchase anything?  If so, where from and how much was it?  Did it turn out the way you had hoped?  Post the schematic and resource that you used as well.  Redraw the schematic if you think you can do it better or more clearly.
  
  - TO DO:
    - Get trained at the [Tandon Makerspace](https://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/training-and-reservations/) if you haven’t already.   

    Here is a [list of great online resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjxx1U3bvpT6oQhSrtqmzX7B6Rh5-sLsodaqWs2NgYs/edit?usp=sharing) for learning more about CMOS chips and finding schematics.  

    Here is a [photo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40703526/136622346-d040cb75-12e4-4d15-bb26-1cf647be22c9.png) of some helpful resistor and capacitor combinations and their frequency ranges.

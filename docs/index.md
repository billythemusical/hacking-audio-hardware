## Course Description
Using the seminal book [*Handmade Electronic Music*](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/141j2p5/nyu_aleph003835343) by Nicholas Collins as our guide, students will experiment building, modifying, hacking basic analog electronics and audio circuits in a hands-on environment.  From opening up common battery-powered objects like toys and radios, we can gain strategic access to their circuit boards and change their intended behavior - for predictable and unpredictable outcomes.  But it is almost always a satisfying endeavor.

Beginning with an introduction to these various DIY (Do-It-Yourself) practices, students advance quickly to building their own circuits with a minimum amount of electronic components. Many of the projects in this course center on common integrated circuits (aka: IC's or microchips), which we will bend, break, and remake in order to create tools/instruments for sonic and aesthetic ends.  Other topics covered include circuit sniffing, circuit bending, alternative speaker construction, and creative uses for transducers, magnetic tape heads, contact mics, radio receivers and transmitters, and magnetic pickups of various types.

Students that successfully complete this course will:
1. Have a very basic understanding of how electrical circuits work, and develop a working knowledge
of basic electronic components including but not limited to IC’s, resistors, capacitors, and diodes.
2. Be able to construct their own circuits both in prototype and finished, useable forms for
presentation and/or performance.
3. Acquire skills soldering together and working with basic audio equipment including microphones, amplifiers, and cables.
4. Have a basic knowledge of the history and development of hardware hacking and circuit bending,
and their contexts in the fields of experimental music and fine art.
5. Understand the ethos and culture of hardware hacking and its important place in DIY (do-it-yourself) art communities.
6. Learn to provide and receive constructive criticism on work produced in the class.

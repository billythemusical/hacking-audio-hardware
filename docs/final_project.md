# Hacking Audio Hardware

## Final Project
The Final Project is 30% of your final grade.  Please submit two (2) seperate blog posts, which will each count for half of your Final Project grade.  Groups and teams are welcome!  

üìå Since we have less than two weeks left in the semester, the project should be something that can be accomplished before the last class.  Final grades are due Dec 23rd, so any late work or extensions must be discussed with me immediately.  


### What To Do
We discussed the following options for a final project:

- Paint/Decorate your Midterm instrument
  - See [Ch. 12 Finishing Techniques](https://eternobisiesto.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/circuit-bending-build-your-own-alien-instruments-reed-ghazala.pdf#page=210) from Creating Your Own Alien Instrument.
  - Check out some [examples](http://www.anti-theory.com/bentsound/) from Ghazala‚Äôs website.
- Making a tape loop
  - Include sounds from your midterm instrument along with any of your own sounds or compositions.
  - We will need to arrange a session to go over the tape machine basics.  Please add your N number to [this form](https://forms.gle/Q4WZZm2oyAus42BDA) if you haven't already.
  - Consider making this a live instsallation to be displayed at 370 Jay St or in your department's end of year showcase.
- Circuit bend an existing instrument 
  - For example, the [GI Joe backpack](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=gi+joe+sonic+fighter+backpack&_sacat=0) or other found instrument.
  - The instrument must be modified in a at least 2 permanent waya, i.e. by add a panic button and bending switch to the instruments case.
- Or **propose your own** interactive project as some have done already!

### How To Do It + Grading
The Final Project is 30% of your final grade.  Please submit two (2) seperate blog posts, which will each count for half of your Final Project grade:  

‚úîÔ∏è **Due Dec 7th** - First post is your proposal plan
  - This will include any drawings or ideation processes, mood boards, inspiration, etc.
  - This might also include build of materials with links for sources and prices...
  - .. and a basic plan of operations, i.e. first I will... and then... etc.  

‚úîÔ∏è **Due Dec 14th** - Second post is documentation of the making of and final form of your final project
  - Any incremental pictures or video showing the way points in the process that link to your original plan.
  - Note any changes or pivots that had to be made, mistakes that were fixed or not overcome, and future improvements, if any. 
  - Pictures + a sample of audio or video with audio of the final product.

üìå*Remember, it's just as much the effort and communication about your project that counts, not the final product alone.
